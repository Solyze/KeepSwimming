# KeepSwimming (fabric)
💧 A Minecraft mod that keeps you afloat in water during actions that would usually make you sink.

### ❓ Keep swimming when:
- Typing in Chat
- Editing Signs
- Trading with Villagers
- Opening Inventories
- And more!

### ⚠️ Disclaimer: Only works in Singleplayer ([Intended](https://modrinth.com/legal/rules))
Due to this technically being a cheat, in order to comply with Modrinth's rules, the mod will not be available on multiplayer servers.

### ✏️ Quick Notes:
- There's a hotkey in your keybind settings. This can be used to toggle the mod.
- The "always" option will make it so you always float in water.
- The "evenflying" option will make the mod work, even when you have flight permissions (creative etc.)

### 🎨 Customization - Command: /keepswimming
